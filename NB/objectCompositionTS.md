OBJECT COMPOSITION:
```sh
# Define individual behavior using interfaces
interface CanFly {
  fly(): void;
}

interface CanSwim {
  swim(): void;
}

# Implement behaviors using separate objects
const flyableMixin: CanFly = {
  fly() {
    console.log("Flying!");
  }
};

const swimmableMixin: CanSwim = {
  swim() {
    console.log("Swimming!");
  }
};

# Compose objects with desired behavior
class Bird implements CanFly {
  constructor() {
    Object.assign(this, flyableMixin);
  }
}

class Fish implements CanSwim {
  constructor() {
    Object.assign(this, swimmableMixin);
  }
}

# Usage
const bird = new Bird();
bird.fly(); // Output: "Flying!"

const fish = new Fish();
fish.swim(); // Output: "Swimming!"

```

NB: why we assign the method in the constructor?
see whyAssignInConstructor

In the above example, we define two separate interfaces: **CanFly** and **CanSwim**. These interfaces describe the behavior each object should have. Then, we create separate objects (flyableMixin and swimmableMixin) that implement the respective behavior.

Next, we use object composition to combine these behavior objects with our Bird and Fish classes. By using Object.assign(), we can copy the properties and methods from the behavior objects to the instances of our classes. This approach allows the classes to inherit behavior without the limitations and **tight coupling** of traditional class inheritance. 

NB: To counter tight coupling we apply the Dependency Inversion Principle. The goal of DIP is to decouple high-level and low-level modules by introducing an abstraction between them. Thus, you can see how object composition is more in the spirit of DIP, although inheritance can too achieve DIP via abstractions. See at bottom for Java code.

The Bird class composes the **CanFly** behavior, while the Fish class composes the **CanSwim** behavior. Each class only inherits the specific behavior it needs, and we can easily combine different behaviors by mixing and matching the objects.

Object composition provides more flexibility than inheritance because you can mix and match behaviors from different sources without creating complex class hierarchies. It promotes code reuse, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

INHERITANCE:

If we were to rewrite the original example using traditional inheritance instead of object composition, it would involve creating a class hierarchy where classes inherit behavior from their parent classes. Here's how it could look:

```sh
# Base class with common behavior
class Animal {
  # ...
}

# Inherited classes with specific behavior
class Bird extends Animal {
  fly() {
    console.log("Flying!");
  }
}

class Fish extends Animal {
  swim() {
    console.log("Swimming!");
  }
}

# Usage
const bird = new Bird();
bird.fly(); # Output: "Flying!"

const fish = new Fish();
fish.swim(); # Output: "Swimming!"
```

In this approach, we have a base class **Animal** that contains common behavior shared by all animals. Then, we create the **Bird** and **Fish** classes as subclasses of **Animal**, inheriting the common behavior.

The **Bird** class adds the fly() method, which is specific to birds, and the **Fish** class adds the swim() method, which is specific to fish.

By using inheritance, the subclasses inherit behavior from the base class, allowing us to call fly() on a **Bird** object and swim() on a **Fish** object.

However, it's worth noting that traditional inheritance can introduce some limitations and potential issues, such as:

- Limited flexibility: Inheritance creates a **tight coupling** between classes, making it harder to modify or extend the behavior dynamically at runtime. Adding new behaviors or changing existing ones may require modifying multiple classes within the inheritance hierarchy.

- Class explosion: As the number of specialized classes increases, the inheritance hierarchy can become complex and difficult to manage, leading to a phenomenon known as "class explosion." This can result in a larger number of classes and deeper hierarchies, making the codebase harder to understand and maintain.

- Inflexible inheritance structure: With inheritance, subclasses are bound to a specific superclass, and changing the inheritance structure can be challenging. It may not be straightforward to mix and match behaviors from different sources, as it requires modifying the inheritance hierarchy. See more on [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://medium.com/ssense-tech/dependency-injection-vs-dependency-inversion-vs-inversion-of-control-lets-set-the-record-straight-5dc818dc32d1)

In contrast, object composition provides a more flexible approach, allowing for dynamic behavior composition and avoiding some of the limitations of traditional inheritance.

INDUSTRY PRACTICE:

In traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like Java and C#, the concept of inheritance is heavily emphasized. While both inheritance and object composition have their uses, OOP languages typically promote inheritance as a primary mechanism for code reuse and structuring classes.

Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes, forming an "is-a" relationship between classes. It promotes code reuse by providing a way to define common functionality in a superclass and extend or specialize it in subclasses. In Java and C#, classes are typically organized in class hierarchies, with subclasses inheriting from superclasses.

Object composition, on the other hand, emphasizes building objects by combining or composing multiple smaller objects, each with its own behavior and responsibilities. This approach enables more flexible and modular code by favoring the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and separate components.

While Java and C# do support object composition to some extent, they often prioritize inheritance due to the following reasons:

- Language design: Java and C# were designed with inheritance as a central feature. The syntax and features of these languages provide strong support for inheritance, making it the default choice for code reuse.

- Polymorphism: Inheritance enables polymorphism, which is a key aspect of OOP. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly when they share a common superclass, promoting flexibility and extensibility.

- Frameworks and libraries: Many Java and C# frameworks and libraries are designed around inheritance. They provide abstract classes or base classes that can be extended to implement specific functionality, encouraging the use of inheritance as a means of customization.

Conclusion:
That said, it's important to note that both inheritance and object composition have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements and design considerations of a given project. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the benefits of object composition and the need to favor it over inheritance in certain situations, leading to the emergence of concepts like composition over inheritance (CoI) and the SOLID principles.






P.S.
```sh
interface Printer {
    void print(String message);
}

class ConsolePrinter implements Printer {
    public void print(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}

class FilePrinter implements Printer {
    public void print(String message) {
        // Write message to a file
    }
}

class Client {
    private final Printer printer;

    public Client(Printer printer) {
        this.printer = printer;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        printer.print("Doing something");
    }
}
```

In this example, the **Printer** interface represents the abstraction for printing functionality. Concrete implementations **ConsolePrinter** and **FilePrinter** inherit from the **Printer** interface and provide their respective implementations.

The Client class depends on the abstraction **Printer** through its constructor. This allows the Client class to work with any concrete implementation of **Printer** without being tightly coupled to a specific implementation. The specific printer can be passed to the Client class, enabling flexibility and easy substitution of printers.

By leveraging inheritance and programming to abstractions, we achieve a more flexible and modular design that aligns with the Dependency Inversion Principle.
